# GM_Tools
a bunch of java CLI used for automating some Game maker actions
such as automating the process of creating a room with a given text file
provided by the custom Room editor(can be found in this repository)

### Room Creator
transforms a .txt file usually generated by the custom-made 
room editor, into a .yy file that game maker can recognize
and be edited for more enhancements.

#### Usage
RoomCreator needs 2 argument to function:
- sFile -- This refers to the .txt file generated by the Room editor
- gmDir -- The project folder of the game to put the room to

always put the "main" or "instances" layer to the second place, right after the Game objects layer
